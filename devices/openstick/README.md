# openstick wip notes

## outstanding issues

- proper option for disabling Splash Task in stage-1
- qtestsign (lol python) still doesn't work cross-host
- wifi + lte
  - the DTB might be wrong, `wlan` module is never loaded

## usage

(note, I am building against a newer nixpkgs than this repo/PR pins)

```
nix-build --argstr device openstick -A outputs.android-abootimg
fastboot flash aboot result

nix-build --argstr device openstick -A outputs.android-fastboot-images
fastboot flash boot result/boot.img
fastboot flash -S 200M rootfs result/system.img
```

NOTE: the `aboot` built here from `lk2nd` sources (but note, is the `lk1st` make target!) is something I've
hacked on in an attempt to prevent devices from becoming semi-bricked. Please note, I have barely any
idea what I'm doing so be careful or wait for someone else to go first. Or be bold, they're fairly cheap devices...

  
## why?

 - `adb`+`fastboot` just work, it seems to present as a USB-stick-form Android device
 - can be purchased for <$10 (see "tested devices" below):
 - has LTE support
   - TODO: note about model compatibility?
 - has Wifi support
 - has at least 384MB of RAM and a swap paritition
 - some have SD card slots
 - potential GPIO support: https://www.zianet.com/jgray/openstick/14Aug2022.html
   - thought: there could be even more GPIO if we get a model with SD card? I've seen that before.
 - potential USB Gadget/Host support: https://www.zianet.com/jgray/openstick/10Aug2022.html
 - serial access (maybe dependent on exact device): https://www.zianet.com/jgray/openstick/09Aug2022.html
 - maybe bluetooth? if kernel supports? (same link ^)

with some creativity this could be a very cheap linux learning platform, the basis of a cheap
IOT project, or a much more powerful (and bulkier) rubberducky platform.

plus I just think it is a silly idea to be able to provision such cheap, devices
via something like [android-webinstall](https://github.com/kdrag0n/android-webinstall)
which, despite being Chrome-specific, would be very "cool".

## other questions:
- [forcing fastboot/EDL with lk2nd and black-stick-v1](https://github.com/OpenStick/OpenStick/issues/17)

## tested devices
 - variant1: [from "Pro Sweety Baby Store" (older black or white variants?)](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/3256803964280481.html?spm=a2g0o.order_list.0.0.21ef1802DXiYI3)
   - <img src="./readme-img/openstick-black-v1.jpg" height="200" title="openstick aliexpress black model" />
   - the exact variant purchased was the "2x black" variety
   - this is labeled `UF896_V1.1` on the top of the board
   - there are eight gold pads in a row on the top edge of the bottom of the board
     if the usb connector is facing to the left
   - the right-most pad is the board's UART TX
   - there is no microSD card slot on this variant
   - **it is unclear how to force EDL mode so these are currently easy to "brick"**
     - **Question**:
     - what is the weird extra internal plastic connector piece that
       seems to depress an internal button/contact on the board?

        <img src="./readme-img/openstick-plastic-shunt.jpg" height="200" title="openstick plastic shunt" />
        </a>
    
 - variant2: [from "Pro Sweety Baby Store" (newer red+white variant?)](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/3256804379039480.html?spm=a2g0o.order_list.0.0.21ef1802DXiYI3)
   - exact variant purchased was the "2x" variety
   - ... well, it has cutout for a microSD card slot, but no microSD card internals
   - yup, it's literally the eaxct same `UF896_V1.1` board...
   - and yes, all of the info on this page identically applies, I literally can't tell which is which with their case off


## status

**latest**:
 - mobile-nixos stage-2 boots, but fails to load basically all kernel modules, doesn't have anything built in and fails to boot
            
**next steps**:   
 1. (wip) flesh out the rest of `devices/openstick/default.nix` with correct partition, device id, usb ids, etc
 2. kernel -
    seems like tons of modules are missing, breaking stage-2?

 3. firmware - better origin?    
    - [already asked on OpenStick about a better origin for firmware than just copying from them](https://github.com/OpenStick/stick-blobs/issues/2)
    - check on ABL passing firmware_path on cmdline and overriding us


## bonus todo:
- build `hyp.bin` from source, or at least get it from the upstream repo's releases?
  - no idea if it's the exact same one: https://github.com/msm8916-mainline/qhypstub
  - not sure if there's really a whole huge point to this?  


## Physical HW

Test Pads (from the "left"; test pads facing up; usb plug on the left)
1. ?
2. GPIO35
3. Serial RX (from mobile-nixos booted anyway)
4. GPIO22
5. ?
6. ?
7. ?
8. Serial TX

Physical Reset Button = GPIO35

### debian image experimentation

first:
- follow the instructions from extrowerk to flash the generic-base and debian image.

then:
- `adb shell` into it
- set a `TERM`
- `nmtui` to connect to a network
- `apt update` + `apt install curl fdisk`
- `systemctl start sshd` to start sshd
- `useradd -m cole` + `gpasswd -a cole sudo` to add a sudo enabled user
- `mkdir /home/cole/.ssh/`
- download your ssh key into there
- fixup .ssh dir + auth_key file perms to make ssh happy

```
